        <h5>Hobbies/interests</h5>
          <p>My passion in life is finding joy in the small moments. I like to enjoy these moments through walks which give me the opportunity to explore the moment. I really enjoy gardening and DIY projects. I’m also a lover of gaming. The game which I play most often is Minecraft.</p>
        <h5>Most memorable moment</h5>
          <p>My most memorable moment in my life would be when I was an educator and teaching the children Spanish. I had a lot of parents approach me that week asking what certain words meant because they had no idea what their children were talking about.</p>

      <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <h5>What is my interest in IT, were did it come from and when?</h5>
          <p>The earliest memory of IT I have that also sparked my passion for IT is as a child (possibly around the age of 12). I remember my father showing me how MS DOS works and how to see the files on the family computer. This sparked my interest in how technology works. From this, I became interested in Qbasic and got my first taste of basic early programming. As my use of technology increased and IT became a larger part of my life, I began questioning how I can do things easier and how I can use the skills I gain to find solutions to problems I found. I began a career in early childhood education and saw the extensive applications that IT has in the education industry. Through my experience I found not only these application for IT not only from a teaching perspective but also as a directive, management, and member of staff perspective. I quickly began seeing innovative ways IT could be applied to the education field to solve problems I found as an educator and make teaching as a team more efficient.</p>
        <h5>IT experience</h5>
          <p>Although I have no formal qualifications or employment in IT, I have experience through hobbies and interests which I have self-taught. As I mentioned in previously, programming sparked an interest for me early on in my life. I began with some Qbasic at this stage and learnt the way computer files are structured in some programs. Later in life I branched out to explore the use of administrative software such as MS Office and Childcare Management Software (CMS) when I performed my role as an early childhood educator. As my time in education came to an end, I developed an interest in gaming. I became very interested in a game called Minecraft which prompted me to begin to create videos on YouTube about my gaming experiences. This led to gaining experience in graphic design, video/audio editing software, java programming and social media.</p>
        <h5>Why I chose to go to RMIT?</h5>
          <p>I chose to attend RMIT and study a bachelor of IT for several reasons. I had already studied early childhood education and very briefly architecture through Open Universities Australia (OUA) and found the flexibility of online learning to be the most appropriate way for me to learn and study. After reading through the modules, I would study and discussing my options with a student adviser from OUA, they helped me enrol in a bachelor of IT through RMIT. </p>
        <h5>What I expect to learn during my studies</h5>
          <p>During my time studying at RMIT, I expect to learn the basics of IT and the IT industry which will give me a great insight into the details of the IT roles and the role that IT plays in different aspects of life. I’m also hoping to achieve the skills and knowledge required to gain employment as part of a team solving complex problems and making process, tools, and procedures more efficient or easier.</p>

      <h2>Ideal Job</h2>

        #make this a link#
        <p>This job first caught my attention because it calls for someone to “design, develop, manage and install” the required software. This would indicate to me that the role would be involved in the project from the forming the groundwork all the way through to monitoring the performance and managing fixes of software. It also calls for someone that will be able to define the functionality and gather user requirements. This information means to me that the role would be working with the company to identify and solve problems that are related to the software that’s developed. From the advertisement, I would describe the role as a position that builds, develops, and evaluates well-made software and is responsible for the technical aspects of this as well as managing a team to assist.
          <p>The skills called for by the employer would include working within a web framework which, from my research, is a framework that makes the development of web applications possible (Wikipedia, nd-c) namely PHP which is a general scripting language (Wikipedia, nd-b) for Magento which is a commerce software (Wikipedia, nd-a) that the company uses. The role also calls for at least 10 years of experience as a software engineer as this is a senior role. As a senior role, a responsibility is also to manage an internal team and external team to assist. Managing a team would require teamwork and communication skills. To fulfill the role successfully, time management would also be a required skill of this role. Although no formal qualifications are called for in the advertisement, my research through Seek (nd) indicates I would require at minimum a relevant Bachelor degree.</p>
          <p>Currently I’m lacking in nearly all the essential skills called for from the advertisement regarding technical knowledge and needed to research to explore further what knowledge I would need to obtain these skills. Regarding formal qualifications, I currently hold no qualifications that are completed.</p>

        <p>To me these results show I favour investigative, empathetic, emotionally driven, and kinetic projects. This means that I tend to favour tasks I’m passionate about that can benefit others, are practical and involve problem solving. My behaviour in a team could be affect by the fact that I’m connected to my emotions and benefiting other people. This could mean I could favour as tasks that reinforces a belief or value of my own or take on task which I feel would benefit the team, but I would not be able to complete. It also means that I would tend to take on the investigator role and find solutions to barriers for the team. The results would also mean that I would work well with a team that needed an investigative view or an empathetic view. I would also do well in the physical implementation of tasks. A team would compliment me if they had traits that could manage workloads appropriately and a team that were skilled in evaluating their personal beliefs and values against the tasks involved.</p>

      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
        <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>For ease of reference, I decided to name my project Care Focus. The project is a web interface that educators in the early childhood care and education industry can use in order to calculate, communicate, record and view child to educator ratios in order to assist educators to better meet the legislative and quality care requirements (Queensland Government, 2021). This project will keep information relating to the current occupancy for the service and educators currently available. It will then use a ratio formula to calculate how many groups of children, what ages the children in each group are and how many staff are required for each group. This data is then stored and made accessible when needed.</p>
        <h5>Motivation</h5>
          <p>My motivation for this project is to enhance the quality of care that educators can provide for children in the early childhood education and care environment. I spent 15 years as an educator in early childhood and have a personal passion for the care and education on young children. During my experience, I found that recording the attendance of children and then being able to compare the current occupancy to the number of educators to calculate staffing needs took a lot of time away that I could be using to develop plans or meet the needs of the children better. Management also aimed to save on costs of staff so required senior educators, such as the role I was in, to ensure that no staff were working when they weren’t needed. This is what began the process of my project idea and the motivation of developing this project.</p>
        <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>The project calls for an interface which educators can use to calculate, communicate, record and view required child to educator ratios as described by Queensland Government (2021) legislation. Educators would access a user interface using an application connected to a web interface. In this application, the educator can then log into to where they can access and record information. The educators will then have a menu on the side which would contain options to edit information to the database or to view it. On the main screen there will be a dashboard that displayed information about how many groups there were currently, how many staff and how many children. When age groups can be merged, a notification will display and possibly an audible notification to ask the educator if they would like to combine age groups depending on the staffing available. They can then choose an option to end an educator’s shift, dismiss the notification or snooze the notification.
          </p>
          <p>When the educators view the data, they will be able to see the number of children currently in the service, the number of staff at the service and the current groups that the children and educators are nominated to. Management could also view staff shift times and children’s’ attendances. In the editing section of the interface, educators would be able to move staff between groups as well as children. This would allow educators to maintain records of the flexibility of grouping arrangements without losing time for teaching. The educators would also have the option of signing children out of the attendance without the record being sent to the software that is connected to the software that is responsible for fees and payroll.</p>
          <p>The project does have some small drawbacks which mostly relate to the secure storage and use of data regarding the families and children that attend the service. The application would require secure enough means as to not jeopardize the privacy of the service employees, trade secrets or the families which attend. This would be done by using a secure source to store the data and the need for educators to log in to the application would increase security. To further increase security of the data, 2 factor authentication could be used</p>
          <p>The project would be compatible for both apple, android, and PC devices to use and retrieve data from the software that’s responsible for maintaining a roll of the children currently in attendance. If the service doesn’t have this software, they are able to add children from a database which is formed upon the enrolment of a child at the service. Educator information will be retrieved from the software responsible for maintaining payroll or time clocks. If the service doesn’t have this software, upon beginning employment, all educators will fill out a profile either using the web interface accessible via PC or the application. The profile will include the job title, any employee identification number, and any qualifications the educator has as well as a photo of the educator. When an educator begins a shift, they will then log in to the application and mark themselves as working. At the end of a shift, the educator will mark themselves as finished working.</p>
          <p>The data for the application will be stored on a cloud which the application can access when needed. Should the incorrect information be shown, an educator is able to edit the data. The ratio formula that the application would use would be based on the current legislation. Staff that are not working directly with children aren’t included in the ratio formula and are able to be moved by an educator that is using the application to a dedicated group called <em>non-contact</em>.</p>
        <h5>Tools and Technologies</h5>
          <p>I researched the tools and technologies that might be included to make this project work. If an application was to be made for apple products then according to AWS (nd) XCode would be need to run a graphics interface and include everything you would need to design, develop, write and debug an iOS application or alternatively swift coding could be used. To develop an application on the android system, then Android studio could be used as both a graphical and a code based software to design, test and implement android applications (Android, n.d.). As for the web application for the project, using HTML a web application could be designed (AppsGeyser, 2020). The storage and networking related to the data which the educators input would utilize cloud computing in order to store all the data in a place that is accessible to any device via the application which is suggested by Reply Alpha (n.d.). To ensure privacy and security of data, 2 factor authentication use would also be needed such as talked about by (Bozho, 2017).</p>
        <h5>Skills Required</h5>
          <p>The skills required to make this project work would consist of several disciplines. To begin the process of developing the application, skills in XCode or swift would be needed as well as skills in Android studio would be required. This will give the necessary interface needed for the application to be used on android and apple devices. To develop a web-based interface, skills in html coding would be needed to design the web application for the project. The next step would be developing the storage of the data collected from user input or from databases of other software. Pulling this data from other software would depend on how the software stores the data of its own. Skills in cloud computing would be needed for this part to store and retrieve the data through a third party. To utilize the 2 factor authentication work flow, Bozho (2017) talks about using java code. This would mean that skills in java coding would also be needed. A background knowledge of the early childhood education and care industry would also be an advantage as this means very little research would be required to know the correct formulas for educators, however knowledge of the formulas to calculate educator to child ratios would be mandatory. This knowledge could be obtained through research of legislation.</p>
        <h5>Outcome</h5>
          <p>This project’s aim is to create an interface that educators in the early childhood care and education industry can use to calculate, communicate, record and view child to educator ratios to assist educators to better meet the legislative and quality care requirements. I predict this project, when completed, would deliver this objective. After educators have set up the initial profile and children have been entered into the database, the application will allow educators simple and easy access to not only view but also record, communicate, and quickly calculate the care requirements for the children in their care. I predict this would have a great impact on the early childhood education and care industry in the way it will allow educators more time to spend teaching and implementing the educational and care plans they create or planning lessons as well as ensuring the children in their care are supervised according to researched legislation.</p>
